# Using abstraction concept on superclass in java
This code splits the Employee and Main classes into separate files, Employee.java and Main.java respectively. 
You can compile and run the Main.java file to execute the program.

In this program, we define the Employee class with four instance variables: ID, name, mobile, and salary. 
We then create four Employee objects with initial values and store them in an array. 
Finally, we loop through the array and display the information of the employee whose name is "Ahmad". 
We use abstraction by declaring the instance variables as private and providing public getter methods to access them. 
This encapsulates the implementation details of the Employee class and allows us to access its properties in a controlled and consistent manner.
